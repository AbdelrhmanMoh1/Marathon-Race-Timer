# Marathon-Race-Timer

A web-based app designed to manage marathon timing and results. It includes a precise stopwatch (accurate to hundredths of a second) for starting, stopping, and resetting races, records lap splits for each runner under a unique session ID, saves data using Local Storage for offline use, and allows clearing or exporting results as a CSV file.
